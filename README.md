# Matrix Operations

This set of algorithms performs matrix operations including element-wise product and dot product, and checks the orthogonality of vectors.

## Algorithms

### 1. Procedure: `procedure_name`

**Description:**
- Calculates the element-wise product of two arrays.
- Exits if the arrays are not of the same length.

**Usage:**
1. Call `procedure_name` with two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. The result is the element-wise product stored in the `total` variable.

**Example:**
```algorithm
SET arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
SET arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
CALL procedure_name(arr1, arr2, total)
WRITE total  // Output:  [4, 10, 18]

**2. Function: dot_product
Description:

. Calculates the dot product of two arrays.
. Returns an error message if the arrays are not of the same length.
Usage:

1. Call dot_product with two arrays, arr1 and arr2.
2. The result is the dot product of the arrays.

Example:
SET arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
SET arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
SET result = dot_product(arr1, arr2)
WRITE result  // Output: 32

3. Algorithm: orthogonal

Description:
Checks the orthogonality of three vectors, v1, v2, and v3.

Usage:

1. Initialize vectors v1, v2, and v3.
2. Run the orthogonal algorithm to check orthogonality.
Example:
SET v1 = [1, 0, 0, 1]
SET v2 = [0, 1, 0, 0]
SET v3 = [0, 0, 0, 1]

CALL orthogonal
The algorithm will output whether the pairs of vectors are orthogonal or not.
